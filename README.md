Classification 


Airline Passenger Referral Prediction is a classification project aimed at enhancing customer satisfaction and revenue growth in the airline industry. The project seeks to predict which passengers are likely to recommend the airline to their networks, providing strategic insights for marketing and service improvements.

The workflow includes data collection, cleaning and preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and model selection. Various classification models, such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machines (SVM), are employed, with hyperparameter tuning to optimize performance. Key evaluation metrics focus on Recall, Accuracy, and ROC AUC to ensure reliable identification of potential referrers.

By accurately predicting passenger referrals, airlines can tailor customer engagement efforts and boost their brand reputation.
